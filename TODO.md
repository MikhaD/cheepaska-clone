## Technical debt
- [x] add the event listeners to a larger main element or to body to allow releasing from off the board
- [x] seperate javascript into semantic classes
- [ ] Use squared values instead of the sqrt function for finding distances to improve speed
- [ ] Make balls array into a static variable of the Ball class
